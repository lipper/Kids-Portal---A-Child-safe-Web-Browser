# Kids-Portal---A-Child-safe-Web-Browser
Uses Web Scraping Techniques

A child-safe web browser, where no parents will ever be worried again for the safety of their children while surfing the internet.
Kids Portal is designed especially for kids 3 to 8 years old, an easy-to-use and simplistic internet browser software. 
Kids Portal is an extra layer of protection to keep your kids safe and prevent them from any inappropriate or explicit adult material 
on the internet. Kids Portal's robust protection is what separates it from any existing similar software. 
After downloading and installing Kids Portal, an initial setup for settings and preferences will be prompted to the parent
setting up the software. A settings panel where themes can be changed, level of protection be adjusted, and reports be viewed.

Kids Portal will automatically block the website or page, making it unviewable to the user, if it detects a prohibited parameter.
Using Kids Portal's data scraping algorithm, the parameters are data being extracted from the page that is being loaded. 
The default list of prohibited terms consists of more than 1000 terms, and parents have the option to go to the settings to add more.

Kids Portal's data scraping algorithm runs real time, even after the page has successfully loaded to the browser, 
to ensure real time protection and prevention from any inappropriate or explicit material that may pop-up.

A report panel that is only viewable to the parent admin, where full reports of user accessing or encountering prohibited 
parameters are shown.

A help panel that is only viewable to the parent admin, where manual of the Kids Portal can be found.

Kids Portal also includes basic functions such as bookmarking a page, browser history, home page, and tabbed browsing.
